## About Us -

Fragrantica is an online encyclopedia of perfumes, a perfume magazine,
and a community of perfume lovers. Fragrantica informs its readers about
new perfume launches, famous fragrances, and less-known but wonderful
scents. Together we travel in time and space, where perfumes are the
shining stars we use to navigate. We learn about their history, discover
far-away places, and respectfully explore the life we see around us,
always taking time to be amazed by Nature. Fragrantica is a place to
learn from each other and relax in the company of your soul mates.
